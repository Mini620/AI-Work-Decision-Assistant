This project simulates AI-based decision-making for commuting using propositional logic
This program is centered around a "model" function which tell you what you should do depending on the knowledge and the conditions provided.
The program give you option that respects knowledge considering conditions, but it doesn't make any priority between option, they might look incoherent but
this way the program can be adapted considering different goals like optimising time/comfort/envirronment.
To use it just execute : python datatest.py in a terminal.
Ps : I forced push a couple time soo I destroyed some of my previous version.
