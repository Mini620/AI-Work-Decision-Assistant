This project simulates AI-based decision-making for commuting using propositional logic.
This program is centered around a "model" function which tell you what you should do depending on the knowledge and the conditions provided.
The program give you options that respects knowledge considering conditions, but it doesn't make any priority between options, results might sometimes (like scenario 4) look incoherent but this way the program can be adapted considering differents goals like optimising time/comfort/envirronment.
To use it just execute : python datatest.py in a terminal.
Ps : I forced push a couple time soo I destroyed some of my previous version.
